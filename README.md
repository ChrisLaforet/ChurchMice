# Church Mice - Open Source software for small churches
![Logo](https://github.com/ChrisLaforet/ChurchMice/blob/main/Images/ChurchMice150.png?raw=true) Meet the "Church Mice" 

This package will begin its life bringing the most critical piece to small churches.  Church mice are very social and so they want to be able to recognize other church mice.  Thus, initial development will center on creating user accounts and being able to add demographic information and photos to create an online directory.  The next stage would be, since the membership of the church is now available, to permit each member to select electronic distribution of newsletters and bulletins.

From there, the next step that makes sense (since Church Mice are generous folks), is to be able to track giving and provide statements.  Another aspect of their generosity is that Church Mice are willing to serve and meet the needs of their church.  Thus, the next logical extension would be to track their gifting and service opportunities.  A part of this piece of the software would be the tracking of background checks, training records, and other required documentation.

What's next?  Maybe an online giving portal?  Perhaps a check-in/check-out for kids?  Who knows...

# Configuration

Todo - discuss .net and angular configs


# Logo

The initial logo is an assemblage of images which include:

Church - https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-brmuu
Pair of mice by Petsafe - https://www.cleanpng.com/png-computer-mouse-transformice-clip-art-mouse-1105056/
Mouse by Sanchi - https://www.cleanpng.com/png-mouse-cartoon-royalty-free-illustration-cartoon-cu-304664/
Mouse by Monitha - https://www.cleanpng.com/png-mouse-cartoon-child-photography-clip-art-mice-973333/download-png.html

These are free for personal use, and until something changes in this project to make it anything other than personal, they can stand.  Of course, if someone is gifted at cartooning and wishes to try their hand at something, that would be really neat...
